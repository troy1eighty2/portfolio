                    <p>
                        Sometimes, my silly little mind has silly little thoughts that I think would be fun to journal so I wanted to use this website as a platform to share these ideas with 
                        you.

                    <p>
                        I got the idea to create a web portfolio when I first decided to up my game as a computer science student during sophomore year of college. I wanted a little corner of 
                        the internet all to myself and I thought this would be the way to do it. Plus, i was going through a LinkedIn phase where I was connecting with other people, checking out 
                        their profiles and what everyone was up to. I was also greatly inspired by people like <em>Bruno Simon</em> with his <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" target="_blank"> 3js interactive driving sim e-portfolio</a>
                        or <em>Steve Losh</em> with his "gets the job done" minimalistic but memorable <a href="https://stevelosh.com/" target="_blank">e-blog.</a>
                    </p>
                    <img src="blog/eportfolioblog/brunosimonportfolio.jpg">
                    <p>
                        I learned the basics of web development on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">mdn web docs</a>, bless Mozilla. Their documentation is so easy to 
                        read and understand that even a noob like me quickly grasped the essential concepts of the box model and html structures (Although to be fair, html isn't exactly the hardest 
                        thing in the world). I was coding along with mdnwebdocs for a solid week or two before I transitioned to youtube tutorials. I built a website or two using youtube tutorials to 
                        get the hang of creating the basic components of a website such as a nav bar with html and css, then I decided to start working on my portfolio. I did the whole thing solo and it 
                        took me a few weeks of procrastinating because of work and finals, but we got it done. It was a really enrichening experience that let me delve headfirst into several new technologies.

                        I think this website is really goofy and it is essentially being held together with Elmer's glue and some scotch tape. In the future, I want to replace this portfolio with a 
                        React build. Creating these articles is also a nightmare because the entire blog was hardcoded so I want to eventually replace it with a CMS or maybe just improve the whole process 
                        of writing and managing articles with a database, since I did take that class last semester. For now, it serves its purpose. I guess. LOL. Expect lifting and tech related content in 
                        the future.

                <div class="articlebody">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>We are given a list of nums integers and asked to return the indices corresponding to 2 integers in the nums list that add up to a target value. We have been told that there is only one solution to the 
                        problem to simplify it. We want to iterate through the list, keeping track of each element and its index. We can do this with either <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/enumerate-in-python/" target="_blank">enumerate</a> 
                        or a for loop that iterates over the length of the nums list. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the for loop, we have access to each value in the list and realize that by subtracting this value from the given target, we get the second 
                        number required to have two numbers that sum up to the given target because addition and subtraction are inverse operations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can move onto the next value if the two values calculated are not our target, but we want to add the processed value to our dict with the 
                        value as the key and the index of that value as the value.
                    </p>
                    <img src="blog/twosumblog/twosumexample.png">
                    <p>
                        Here, we can see that our for loop processes the first item in the nums array, which is a 2, and checks if its pair is already discovered and placed into the dict. If it hasn't discovered its pair, it 
                        makes a new dict item with "2" being the key and "0" being the value and moves on to the next iteration. In the second iteration, it has discovered that the pair exists in dict, so the code will return 
                        the index of the nums value it is currently processesing and use "target - nums[i]" as a key to the dict to find its pair and return the pair's index.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Methodologies</h2>
                    <code>
                        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
                    </code>
                    <p>i will be the value of the index and n will be the value at nums[i]</p>
                    <code>
                        for i in range(len(nums)):
                    </code>
                    <p>i will be the value of the index of n</p>
                    <img src="blog/twosumblog/twosum1.png">
                    <p>The heart of the problem: if the pair of n is already in dict, then return the indice of n and use the pair of n as the key to get the pair of n's index and return it.</p>
                    <h2>Time Complexity / Space Complexity</h2>
                    <p>
                        We only have to traverse through the given nums array once, which can take as long as the length of nums. Finding the value of hash items with a key is a O(1) operation, so the time complexity is O(N).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need to create a dict that has the possibility of being as long as our given nums array, so the space complexity is O(N).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is considered the easiest Leetcode problem, but I actually think this one is a head scratcher if you are trying to solve it in O(N) time. People will intuitively try to brute force the problem, which 
                        will result in a terrible TC. I use this problem to practice things for the first time, like a new algorithms platform or video format or even a blog article.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the first problem I solved and made a blog for. I have discovered a few issues, especially with making code blocks in html, so I need to go fix those things. I want to also do problems in a more 
                        step by step manner. I also need to figure out a good setup for my file system so that things are well organized.
