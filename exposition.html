                    <p>
                        I decided to create a personal website. I made it so I have a place to redirect people to all my social media and ecommerce links as well as to document random stuff 
                        that I have done throughout my career as an engineer.

                        Sometimes, my silly little mind has silly little thoughts that I think would be fun to journal so I wanted to use this website as a platform to share these ideas with 
                        you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got the idea to create a web portfolio when I first decided to up my game as a computer science student during sophomore year of college. I wanted a little corner of 
                        the internet all to myself and I thought this would be the way to do it. Plus, i was going through a LinkedIn phase where I was connecting with other people, checking out 
                        their profiles and what everyone was up to. I was also greatly inspired by people like <em>Bruno Simon</em> with his <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" target="_blank"> 3js interactive driving sim e-portfolio</a>
                        or <em>Steve Losh</em> with his "gets the job done" minimalistic but memorable <a href="https://stevelosh.com/" target="_blank">e-blog.</a>
                    </p>
                    <img src="blog/brunosimonportfolio.jpg">
                    <p>
                        I learned the basics of web development on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">mdn web docs</a>, bless Mozilla. Their documentation is so easy to 
                        read and understand that even a noob like me quickly grasped the essential concepts of the box model and html structures (Although to be fair, html isn't exactly the hardest 
                        thing in the world). I was coding along with mdnwebdocs for a solid week or two before I transitioned to youtube tutorials. I built a website or two using youtube tutorials to 
                        get the hang of creating the basic components of a website such as a nav bar with html and css, then I decided to start working on my portfolio. I did the whole thing solo and it 
                        took me a few weeks of procrastinating because of work and finals, but we got it done. It was a really enrichening experience that let me delve headfirst into several new technologies.

                        I think this website is really goofy and it is essentially being held together with Elmer's glue and some scotch tape. In the future, I want to replace this portfolio with a 
                        React build. Creating these articles is also a nightmare because the entire blog was hardcoded so I want to eventually replace it with a CMS or maybe just improve the whole process 
                        of writing and managing articles with a database, since I did take that class last semester. For now, it serves its purpose. I guess. LOL. Expect lifting and tech related content in 
                        the future.
