## Vision
This project is a dynamic online portfolio created with the purpose of self-learning. This eportfolio serves as a centralized hub housing all my ecommerce links, an introduction to my identity as an engineer, 
and a showcasing of my professional work and experiences. This web page will additionally function as the gateway to my eblog, a platform where I share my reflections and insights concerning contemporary technologies, 
online tech programs, and log my journey towards crushing the technical interview and mastering datastructures and algorithms.
